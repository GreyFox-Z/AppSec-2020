# A Vulnerable Web Application
## Learning Objective

Based on what you know about the various typed of vulnerabilities that an application can be subject to, I'd like you to write a small app that is vulnerable to at least two security issues. 

## Detailed Requirements

You can write a brand new app or build on your assignment from Lab 1. 

Examples:

- XSS
- CSRF
- SQLi
- Buffer Overflow
- Weak authentication 
- Vulnerable dependency

## Deliverables

Your deliverable can either be a virtual machine running your app or instructions on how to install and run it. Please also provide a short write up of the vulnerabilities youâ€™ve included. 

## Installation 
#### Pre-requested:

- `XAMPP` is required to run this application. (I only tested on Kali Linux) <br> Please download the `XAMPP` with this [Link](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

#### Installation Process:
Change the permissions to the installer 

`chmod 755 xampp-linux-*-installer.run`

Run Installer 

`sudo ./xampp-linux-*-installer.run`

That's all. XAMPP is now installed below the `/opt/lampp` directory.


## How to run this application?


## Examples of Vulnerabilities

#### 1. XSS 
```
Project 1> python .\Image_Size_Modifier.py Test.jpg
Completed...
The modified image could be found as Test_modified.jpg
```


#### 2. SQLi 



#### 3. Command Execution
