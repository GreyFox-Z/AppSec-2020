# A Vulnerable Web Application
## Learning Objective

Based on what you know about the various typed of vulnerabilities that an application can be subject to, I'd like you to write a small app that is vulnerable to at least two security issues. 

## Detailed Requirement

You can write a brand new app or build on your assignment from Lab 1. 

Examples:

    XSS
    CSRF
    SQLi
    Buffer Overflow
    Weak authentication 
    Vulnerable dependency


## Deliverables

Your deliverable can either be a virtual machine running your app or instructions on how to install and run it. Please also provide a short write up of the vulnerabilities youâ€™ve included. 

## Installation 
## How to run the script
The script could be executed as `python Image_Size_Modifier.py [image name]`

For more information, please access to the help page `-h`
```
python .\Image_Size_Modifier.py -h
usage: Image Size Modifier [options] image

Resize an image to a square

positional arguments:
  image       Provide the image file name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

## Example
```
